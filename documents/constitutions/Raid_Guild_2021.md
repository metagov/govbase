# Code of Conduct

Before we dive in, here is a quick code of conduct to keep in mind:

- Professionalism - We prioritize shipping at all costs. Our main goal is to meet deadlines and deliver valuable output in a timely manner. If you commit to a Raid, you should be prepared to do anything and everything to make sure it gets done.

- Respect - Raid Guild is a no-beef zone, meaning that we do not discriminate and expect you to withhold all judgement while interacting in or with Raid Guild.

- Collaboration - Raid Guild is meant to foster new relationships. Please be open to inviting new members to your Raid as you’re likely to be pleasantly surprised by what you find.

- Honor - Becoming a member of Raid Guild is no easy feat. We ask that all those involved with Raid Guild treat our brand as a seal of honor. This means being kind to others inquiring about the Guild, and speaking favorably about it when presenting on behalf of the Guild in public. If there is something you do not like about the Guild, please vocalize it internally so that we can do our best to resolve it.

- Free Speech - Raid Guild is an idea meritocracy. We invite you to share your opinion. In fact, we encourage contentious opinions so long as they are presented in a constructive manner.

With that, let’s learn about the Raid Guild!

Note: Is there something you don’t see in the Handbook that you have questions about? Open an issue here to let us know what we should add!

## Raid Guild Shares

All Shares are non-transferable and unique to the DAO being used (in this case Raid Guild).

Each share represents a pro-rata claim on the underlying capital pool and can be exchanged at any time using the Ragequit feature.

There is no cap on the amount of shares that can be issued, and each share carries one vote.

All new shares are issued at a rate of 5 wxDAI/share and new members may request a maximum of 100 shares when joining.

## Non-Voting Shares

Loot, or non-voting shares are similar to normal shares in that they can be Rage Quit to withdraw an amount proportional to your pro-rata claim on the Guilds assets held by War Chest. For instance, if you're requesting funding for work that you completed you may request Loot > wxDAI for that work.

# Roles

Just as with any strong Discord, we use Roles to showcase different skill sets. These Roles are used to Summon Guilders for different Raids, and should only be assigned if you can be called upon to complete the necessary tasks associated with each of them.

You can assign yourself roles by going to the #start-here channel and clicking on the emoji underneath the legend/description of all the roles. The role will then be automagically assigned to you.

Notice a role (or skill) we’re missing? Suggest a new one in the #ops channel and if you get soft consensus deploy it!

As it stands today, Guilders holding at least one share can assign themselves any role they see fit. Please do not overassign yourself in order to give those who are highly skilled in specific areas the chance to shine. We recommend assigning a maximum of 5 roles to start and branching outwards over time.

Roles will be crucial to the development and maintenance of skill-trees, which we hope will fit nicely with a web3 profile that travels with you throughout the Metaverse. More on this later..

# Become and Apprentice

Become an Apprentice

Raid Guild has instituted an onboarding process through the utilization of Cohorts, you can see how Raid Guild introduced Season0 participants to the Guild here.

The TL;DR on Cohorts is that Raid Guild saw an immediate need to onboard various different roles into the Guild and get them up to speed on how Raid Guild operates so they would be ready to slay web3 product demons.

Note If Season(n) is in session or has not yet begun, we recommend that you find someone with the role @TavernKeeper to vouch for you and get you setup as an Apprentice.

All new entries will start as an Apprentice. Apprentices can earn a maximum of 1 share and may be upgraded to a Guilder by pledging 500 wxDAI as tribute for 100 Shares after being championed. Here’s how it works:

    Submit an application on the Raid Guild homepage > Join Us.
        Take your time filling out the Join Us form, as we will determine whether or not you’re a good fit for the Guild based on your ability to effectively communicate your skills and the value you will bring to the Guild as an Apprentice. Also, keep in mind that simply filling out the “Join Us” form does not guarantee you entry into Raid Guild as an Apprentice.

    Join the Raid Guild Discord and introduce yourself in #tavern.

    Showcase your past work and skills in #shill-your-stuff.

    Look out for issues to work on in #projects to earn reputation.

    Once you prove yourself with the skills and reputation, a member of the Guild will signal your eligibility to receive your 1 Apprentice Share.

    Submit a Membership Proposal for 1 Share with 0 Token Tribute in Raid Guild DAO.

    Once the proposal passes, you will be given access to member exclusive channels.

    For the remaining 99 shares to get yourself promoted from an Apprentice to Member, you will need to have worked on one Raid or RIP (See How to Join a Raid) and pledge with funds you earn while raiding or have at your disposal through other means.

    A Member will oversee your progress and once it's done, you will be championed in #champions as a signal for your remaining 99 share proposal.

    Submit a Member Proposal for 99 Shares with 495 wxDAI Tribute in Raid Guild DAO.

    Once the proposal passes, you are now a full Raid Guild Member.

Note: In some cases, Members may earn shares for past work instead of pledging tribute. However, each Member is expected to contribute 500wxDAI (or 500 wxdDAI worth of value) to the DAO in order to become a Member.

## Become a Member

To advance from an Apprentice to a Member, you will need to be Championed by an existing Raid Guild Member. Once you find a Champion, there are a few Your champion will need to put down a stake of $RAID tokens. See the Champion a New Member for how this works.

Once you’ve found a Champion, you are eligible to level up from an Apprentice to a Member - signalled by 100 Shares as opposed to 1. Here's what to do:

Follow the Proposal Process and use the Membership Proposal to request the difference in Shares to get to your 100 Share cap in the Raid Guild DAO. In the description of your proposal, enter a blockscout link to the staking transaction that your Champion gives you. This is how the DAO will validate that your Champion made the appropriate stake.
info

Please note that all new members are capped at 100 Shares for 500 wxDAI.

Once your proposal has passed and been processed, you'll now have 100 Shares and full membership in Raid Guild!

To get access to member-exclusive channels in the Raid Guild Discord server, head to the #member-join channel and enter the !join command. Then follow the CollabLand instructions to get your @Raid Guild Member role. Now you're ready to join a raid!

To ensure that your Champion gets their $RAID stake back, you'll need to fulfill the following 3 criteria within your first 60 days as a member (starting from when your membership proposal is processed):

    Successfully join at least 1 raid or RIP. This include raids or RIPs completed within the first 60 days as well as raids or RIPs still in progress (provided that you are in good standing on that project).
    Attend at least 2 Guild meetings, including Roundtable and Raider Rally.
    Demonstrate shared values with the Guild (at the discretion of the DAO).


## Champion a New Member

Raid Guild grows organically, adding new members as individual existing members deem appropriate and champion them in. Our championing process relies both on the Champion being a good judge of who is a good fit for the Guild as well as on the Champion’s reputation within the Guild being at stake.

In addition to reputation, to ensure that we are only bringing the highests quality new members, Champions must also put down $RAID as a semi-financial stake.

We also recognize that Championing involves a degree of mentorship. To encourage and compensate Champions for their mentorship of new members, Champions of successful new members will receive a $RAID reward in addition to receiving back their original stake.
$RAID Staking#

To champion a new member, a Champion must stake $RAID. The stake amount depends on the type of applicant:

    If the applicant has finished one of the Raid Guild Cohorts, the required stake is 25,000 $RAID
        Exception: if the Champion is from the same cohort season as the applicant, the required stake is the same as for non-cohort applicants.
    If not, the required stake is 50,000 $RAID

The Champion will receive their stake back if the new member meets the success criteria outlined below.
$RAID Reward#

Champions receive a reward of 25,000 RAID if their new member meets success criteria outlined below.
Success Criteria#

New members are successful when they contribute to the Raid Guild community, bring in value to the Guild, and earn income for themselves.

Within the first 60 days after their membership proposal is processed, new members must:

    Successfully join at least 1 raid or RIP. This include raids or RIPs completed within the first 60 days as well as raids or RIPs still in progress (provided the member is in good standing on that project).
    Attend at least 2 Guild meetings, including Roundtable and Raider Rally.
    Demonstrate shared values with the Guild (at the discretion of the DAO).

Championing Process#

Follow these steps to Champion in a new member:

    Stake the appropriate amount of $RAID by transferring the $RAID to the New Member Championing minion at this address: 0x45b49f854eebadbdb59ede30fe5b37ba56a0f26c.
    Send the blockscout transaction url for your stake transaction to the applicant.
    Have the applicant submit a membership proposal to the DAO and include the stake transaction url in the proposal description.
    If/once the proposal passes and is processed, help the new member get onboarded and engaged in Guild activities.
    Record your new member's activity related to the new member success criteria.
    If/once your new member has met the new member success criteria, make a proposal requesting your original stake plus your reward from the New Member Championing minion. Your proposal should include proof of the new member's achievements against the success criteria. This is how the Guild will validate their success.s

## RIPs
Apply for RIP Funding#

Raid Guild Improvement Proposals, commonly referred to as “RIPs”, are an invaluable piece to ensuring that Raid Guild operates at its fullest capacity 24/7.

RIPs are generally focused on Guild internal operations, but in some cases, RIPs have manifested in the Guild building open-source tools for the wider web3 ecosystem.

Smart Invoice is a great example, as it began development as an internal tool (escrow) for Raiders to obtain payment from their clients.

If this excites you, we encourage you to keep reading!

Looking to receive funding for a Raid Guild Improvement Proposal (RIP)? We suggest receiving soft consensus from the DAO before putting anything onchain. The best way to do this is as follows:

    Create an issue on the RIPs Repo detailing why it benefits the DAO and how it will be executed.
    Add the new issue to the RIP Requests Project (or ask a keeper).
    Share that request in Discord under the #rip-discussion Guild HQ channel.

If you don’t yet have the talent you need to execute the RIP, make sure to drop a link to your proposal along with a brief TL;DR to the #who-is-available channel and outline the different roles you need for the RIP. Share the proposal during the weekly Roundtable for additional comments and feedback.

Once you have completed the preceding steps, double check to make sure you and your team have everything you need to make an official proposal to the DAO

Next, refer to the proposal process below to request funding for your RIP.

By following these steps, your proposal will receive far more feedback and have a much higher chance of being passed.


# Community Overview

There are a few meetings each week that we encourage all Guild Members to attend. Raider Rally is a meeting for Guild members to discuss progress across different RIPs and Raids, as well as provide teams in the Preparing for Battle phase with possible personnel for their Raid/RIP.

In addition to the Raider Rally, each week Raid Guild alternates between a Raid Guild Futures meeting and a Round Table meeting. The Futures meeting engages members in a discussion about the future of the guild and it consequently seeks to align members in the longer-term vision for where we want to take Raid Guild. The Round Table is a meeting where we introduce new members, provide Raid updates and discuss Raid Guild improvement ideas.

If you have a share and would like an invite to the recurring Roundtable call, please drop a message in RaidHQ #general channel so that someone can add you or just ask a @Tavern Keeper.

There is also a meeting set strictly for Happy-Hour in the Guild, which we strongly encourgae you join for it's cultural reconaissance.
