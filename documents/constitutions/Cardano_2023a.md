# CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN ECOSYSTEM CONSTITUTION

The Principles Governing the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem

Listed below  are the principles we identified that we believe should govern the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem (not in any relevant order).  Each Article of the Constitution below includes references to the principle(s) supported by that Article.  Without  centralized governmental institutions to enforce these principles, and without a judicial system with the power to penalize violations of failures to comply with these principles, it is critical that we clearly articulate these principles within the provisions of the Constitution.  By creating a clear roadmap of the principles we believe should be enshrined within the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem, we are able to empower the Constitutional Committee with the ability to prevent future actions that are contrary the these Constitutional Principles and assure the ongoing health, functionality, sustainability and growth of the Cardano Blockchain.  This Constitution seeks to obtain a balance between being prescriptive where necessary and aspirational where possible.  

This is an Interim Constitution.  It must be ratified by the Cardano community in 2024 and, therefore, may change based on the desires of the community.  However, given that on-chain governance will come into existence, requiring a robust constitution and constitutional committee, before a final constitution has been ratified, this Interim Constitution must be sufficiently robust and wholesome to support the needs and requirements of CIP-1694, assuring that the below identified principles are not compromised, until the date on which a a final constitution is ratified.  

In approaching this Constitution, it must be remembered that this is not a constitution for only a blockchain but rather, it is a constitution for a blockchain ecosystem–a much more ambitious endeavor.  Accordingly, how governance actions are approved, while extremely important, is not the sole focus of this Constitution.  Rather, this Constitution provides the basis and fundamental framework through which all actors in the Cardando Blockchain Ecosystem can come together to govern themselves and form radically new approaches to human interaction and collaboration.  By necessity, this Constitution recognizes the roles of and empowers the Constitutional Committee, the Member-Based Organization and DReps.  The Constitution also recognizes the necessity of safeguarding access to and the use of funds of the Cardano treasury through the creation of the Cardano Development Trust.

Therefore, it is equally important to keep in mind that this Constitution reflects the difference between governance of a blockchain ecosystem and block validation achieved through PoS mechanisms such as that used by Cardano.  While many scholars have equated block validation with blockchain governance, the process of block validation is only an element, albeit an important one, in the holistic governance needed for an entire blockchain ecosystem.

A final note on drafting:  When this Interim Constitution is finalized, it is intended that the embedded references to principles will be removed but only so long as the text referencing the relevant principle actually supports that principle.  Where it does not, the text itself should not warrant being included in the Constitution.

Cardano Interim Constitution

Preamble

In the beginning of the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem, three pioneering entities, IOHK, Emurgo, and the Cardano Foundation, came together to foster the establishment of a new blockchain, the Cardano Blockchain, laying the foundation for a decentralized network that would empower individuals, promote collaboration, and foster innovation. Their pioneering efforts have shaped the path for a blockchain designed to ensure a fair and transparent environment where all participants can contribute to the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem's growth and success.

Over time, the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem has expanded significantly, and now, thousands of individuals, developers, enterprises, stake pools and others operate in a truly decentralized manner, further strengthening the resilience and autonomy of the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem. As the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem continues to grow, it has become imperative to similarly adapt and evolve its governance model, reflecting the principles of decentralization, community involvement, inclusivity and collaboration that have been the cornerstone of the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem since its start.

Recognizing the need for a more robust and dynamic governance framework, and one that utilizes wherever possible blockchain technology in the governance process, we, the members of this decentralized Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem, hereby establish this Cardano Constitution. It shall serve as a guiding set of principles for the operation and governance of our collective efforts, fostering an environment where all participants can contribute to the betterment of the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem as a whole.

We commit ourselves to uphold the principles enshrined in this Constitution and to work together towards the continuous improvement, growth, and success of our decentralized blockchain ecosystem known as the Cardano Blockchain.

This Constitution shall serve as the embodiment of the guiding principles for the operation and governance of the decentralized Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem, providing a foundation that will adapt and evolve over time to meet the continuing needs of the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem community. All ADA holders and all users of the Cardano Blockchain are expected to abide by this Constitution, actively participate in its governance processes, and work collaboratively towards the betterment of the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem as a whole, contributing to its growth, sustainability, and success.
