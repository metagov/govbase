## Mission Statement

This Constitution was created on August 11, 2022, to outline the goals
of DAO DAO. DAO DAO is a collection of contributors all over the world
who want to give people the tools to create decentralized autonomous
organizations. Decentralized autonomous organizations empower
individuals to organize themselves to accomplish tasks as a group. DAO
DAO's intent is for people to use this technology to improve the quality
of life on Earth and beyond for humans and their more-than-human kin.

### Tools to Make Life Better

The mission of DAO DAO is to build better governance systems. DAO DAO
provides tools to build decentralized autonomous organizations. As DAO DAO
continues to grow and refine its purpose, it will offer better and more
useful tools to all those who wish to use them. Imagine a world in which
decentralized networks of individuals around the world can organize in a
coordinated, transparent, and permissionless way, in real time. To arrive 
at this future, we ("the "Founding Members") must clearly set forth 
DAO DAO's guiding principles and structure in this document. This document
aims to make our intentions clear up front and deter bad actors from
co-opting this project.

### Building Robust and Decentralized Systems

The Founding Members will include the DAO DAO community in the decision
making process for all proposals. One way this will be done is to make
signaling proposals. After a signaling proposal is made, community feedback
can be collected and subsequently reflected in an official proposal. This
will allow contributors to understand what they are working towards,
aligning the incentives of all contributors. As DAO DAO grows to include
more contributors, our governance process will mature. A good governance
process will allow everyone who contributes to DAO DAO to meaningfully
participate.

### Living Document

This Constitution should be considered a "living document" that changes
with the project and the world. Interpretations and circumstances
evolve, and we hope that this Constitution will evolve with technology
and society.

## Legal Definition and Indemnity of Members

1.  **Membership**. DAO DAO is open to all persons, without arbitrary
     discrimination on the basis of race, nationality, religion, age,
     sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability, political
     affiliation, or otherwise. Anyone who holds DAO DAO tokens
     (\$DAO), are valid Members of DAO DAO ("Members"). Members have
     equal rights, as outlined herein, and can contribute anonymously
     if they wish. Members can come and go as they see fit and may
     participate in governance decisions when and how they see fit (or
     not). Members that contribute to DAO DAO may be rewarded by DAO
     DAO via on-chain governance votes or via off-chain rewards. Any
     member or group of Members may distribute their tokens in any way
     they see fit.

2.  **Legal Status of DAO DAO.** Given that anyone in the world can be a
     member of DAO DAO, we want to clarify that DAO DAO does not
     recognize or consent to any particular jurisdiction. It is a
     wholly international, primarily online, organization that exists
     because of the contributions of its global membership. Even if DAO
     DAO interfaces with government institutions in the future, DAO DAO
     views its true jurisdiction as the Internet, and thus maintains
     its jurisdictional independence unless otherwise amended in this
     Constitution.

3.  **Tax Obligations of Members**. All Members are solely responsible
     for their own individual tax obligations related to DAO DAO and
     \$DAO tokens.

4.  **Indemnity for Multi-Signature Signers and Founding Members**. Some
     actions of this DAO must be carried out by multi-signature signers
     ("Signers") or other Founding Members. Signers have a
     non-discretionary duty to carry out the will of DAO DAO. DAO DAO
     will indemnify Signers and Founding Members for any liability
     incurred when carrying out non-discretionary duties on behalf of
     this DAO. The funds for such indemnification (including legal
     fees, costs, and damages) shall be taken from DAO DAO's treasury
     as needed.

5.  **Non-affiliation with User-DAOs**. DAO DAO exists in large part to
     facilitate the creation of more DAOs ("User-DAOs"). These
     User-DAOs are created in a permissionless fashion, and DAO DAO
     does not sanction each User-DAO nor its purpose. DAO DAO does not
     condone nor otherwise affiliate itself with User-DAOs or their
     outcomes. Additionally, no DAO DAO Members or affiliates shall be
     held responsible for the actions of any of its User-DAOs or their
     members. DAO DAO and its members are not responsible for financial
     gain or loss related to User-DAOs.

6.  **Establishment of Sub-DAOs**. Certain decision-making powers may be
     delegated to "Sub-DAOs." Each Sub-DAO shall be responsible for (i)
     making decisions within its respective subject area, and (ii) its
     own operation and maintenance. DAO DAO Members can formally create
     Sub-DAOs by majority vote. Sub-DAOs can be created or dissolved at
     any time by DAO DAO. Sub-DAOs may or may not have treasuries that
     are separate from DAO DAO's main treasury.

## Rights of Members and Voting Procedures

1.  **Rights of Members**. \$DAO token ownership grants the holder a
     right to participate in DAO DAO governance processes. DAO DAO
     shall under no circumstances invalidate Member rights as a result
     of how said Member acquired their \$DAO or for any other reason.
     One staked \$DAO token will be equivalent to one vote in DAO DAO.

2.  **Governance**. The following governance procedures are hereby
     outlined:

    a.  **Voting**. Each staked \$DAO token represents one "vote." A
         "majority vote" means that Quorum (as defined below) has been
         reached and that more than Â½ of all staked \$DAO token holders
         that participate in the vote have voted in a specific
         direction at the time of the vote. All other voting amounts
         referenced in this Constitution shall refer to amounts of
         staked \$DAO outstanding at the time of the vote in question.

    b.  **Making DAO Proposals**. Any Member can propose a DAO Proposal
         ("DP") so long as they have the requisite number of \$DAO tokens
         to bring a proposal (a "Proposal Deposit"). The initial Proposal
         Deposit will be set by DAO DAO and can be changed by majority
         vote. DAO DAO will determine how voting works through DAO DAO
         governance and all relevant information will be stored on-chain.

    c.  **Validly Passed DAO Proposals**. A validly passed DAO Proposal
         shall be defined as a validly brought DAO Proposal that passes
         the DAO's voting process. The voting process will be set by
         DAO governance and defined on-chain, unless otherwise
         specified in this Constitution.

    d.  **Quorum**. Quorum shall initially be set by DAO DAO and can be
         changed by majority vote.

3.  **Code of Conduct**. Harassment, bullying, hate speech, racism,
     sexism, sexual gratuitousness, ageism, homophobia, transphobia,
     and all other forms of discrimination are not tolerated within the
     DAO. Rudeness and consistent negativity are strongly discouraged.
     Members are encouraged to promote an exciting, welcoming space.
     Violating community standards may result in removal from shared
     spaces. Holding \$DAO tokens does not guarantee access to common
     spaces.

## Enforceability and Changing the Constitution.

1.  **Limitations of This Constitution**. DAO DAO recognizes that certain
    decisions cannot be made on-chain. As such, contributors and Founding
    Members may carry out off-chain decisions and initiatives without DAO
    approval, when appropriate. If the necessity of such initiatives are
    called into question, this DAO may vote, through validly passed DPs, to
    suspend the activity or restrict funds that are being used in
    furtherance of said activity.

2.  **Changes to this Constitution**. This Constitution can only be changed
    by a valid Quorum of \$DAO tokens, with a 2/3 majority vote. Any Member
    may propose an amendment. An approved amendment to this Constitution
    shall become effective immediately following approval unless such
    amendment expressly provides otherwise.

3.  **Interpretation**. This DAO shall have the power to interpret this
    Constitution, apply such interpretations to particular circumstances,
    and adopt policies in furtherance of such interpretations, provided
    that all such actions are reasonable and consistent.
