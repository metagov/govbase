## Manifesto

[DAOhaus](https://daohaus.club/) is a platform built by the people, for the people. At its core, DAOhaus looks to empower anyone adding value to the DAOhaus ecosystem, regardless of their social status or previous accolades.

The core ethos of DAOhaus is to create a truly self-sustainable protocol with integrity at heart. [Community should always be prioritized over capital](https://github.com/metacartel/mission/blob/master/community-first-manifesto.md).

The drive to create a truly open ecosystem is one which will take form with time. At inception, DAOhaus will establish the DAOhaus DAO - the governing entity responsible for allocating funding for DAOhaus development and distributing `HAUS` tokens to contributors.

**The DAOhaus DAO is the core vehicle for all fundraising, token distributions, and governance decisions.**

The DAOhaus DAO is built off the following principles:

- **Freedom of Choice** - Enter and exit as your please.
- **Freedom of Work** - Collaboration is encouraged and necessary.
- **Freedom of Power** - No one person or persons own the DAOhaus DAO. Those with the most “influence” are those who are adding the most value.
- **Freedom of Access** - Anyone adding value should receive DAO shares.
- **Freedom of Pay** - Anyone holding DAO shares may submit a funding proposal.
- **Freedom of Opinion** - Not all opinions will be unanimous. We encourage people to speak up and challenge any initiative or proposal which goes against the core ethos of DAOhaus.

### `HAUS` Mentality

`HAUS` represents community support for DAOhaus.

Your contributions will support the development of DAOhaus. You can Rage-quit a proportional share of your remaining `DAI` contribution at any time. Once the `DAI` contributed to the HausDAO is spent, when you Rage-quit you'll receive `HAUS` tokens proportional to the amount of your capital which has been drawn down. `HAUS` tokens do not entitle you to anything. Owning `HAUS` does not mean that you are entitled to DAO shares. DAO shares can only be earned through continued value-added actions. At this time, `HAUS` is just a representation of your contributions to DAOhaus. Thank you for contributing to the DAOhaus community and helping us build the future of DAOs!

### Building the Ownership Economy

DAOhaus looks to curate a community in which product is prioritized over profit. Any and all revenue sent to HausDAO should be allocated to initiatives that support the community. If you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go far go together.

While pioneered by a small team, the key contributors to DAOhaus are always meant to evolve. If successful, the DAOhaus DAO members of 5 years will look exponentially different from the DAOhaus DAO members of today.

We have laid a foundation for future communities to thrive. This manifesto will be updated in accordance to the sentiment of that community.

## Embark Bootstrap Campaign

The role of the bootstrap campaign is to build and support DAOhaus and its community.

This is a tentative plan of action, however, it is subject to change at any time.

### Summoning

The Summoning phase is when the HausDAO will be created.

#### HausDAO Summoning Parameters

- **Deposit token:** `DAI`.
- **Deposit sponsor price:** 20 `DAI`.
- **Processing Reward price:** 5 `DAI`.
- **Period duration:** 2 hour period (7200 seconds).
- **Voting duration:** 3 days (36 periods).
- **Grace duration:** 4 days - (48 periods).

> These parameters are required by an MolochV2 and their terminology is set by the [Moloch codebase](https://github.com/molochVentures/moloch).

#### `HAUS` allocations

We are minting the total `HAUS` supply in the summoning phase and no more `HAUS` will ever be minted.

- 5% of `HAUS` tokens will be distributed into a vesting contract. These tokens will be unlocked when the bootstraping phase is completed (all funds donated for the bootstraping phase are spent) or 1 year after the summoning of the DAO.
- 5-10% of `HAUS` will be earmarked for bootsrapping contributors. As the DAO shareholders create funding proposals to bootstrap the DAOhaus platform, `HAUS` will be tributed into the HausDAO proportionally to the funds being allocated. Once all the funds are allocated the `HAUS` earmarked for bootstrapping contributors will be in the HausDAO at which point contributors can rage-quit their loot (or be rage-kicked) to redeem their proportional share of `HAUS` in the HausDAO GuildBank.
- 1% of `HAUS` is reserved as a user rebate. This will reward users on the HausDAO platform.
- 84-89% of `HAUS` will be held by the HausDAO Minion to be allocated in the future according to the HausDAO community.

#### Initiation

**Core contributors will receive one DAO share to ratify this document. In doing so, core contributors are making an oath to uphold [the core values of the DAO](##Manifesto).**

#### Summoners

- **Db** `0xCED608Aa29bB92185D9b6340Adcbfa263DAe075b`
- **Vg** `0xd26a3f686d43f2a62ba9eae2ff77e9f516d945b9`
- **Sk** `0x83ab8e31df35aa3281d630529c6f4bf5ac7f7abf`
- **Cp** `0x5b93ff82faaf241c15997ea3975419dddd8362c5`
- **Jw** `0x6dc43be93a8b5fd37dc16f24872babc6da5e5e3e`

### Manifestation Phase

During the Manifestation phase:

- Only member proposals will be made.
- Contributors can contribute `DAI` in exchange for `Loot` (non-voting shares).
- The `Loot` purchase rate is fixed for all parties at a rate of 2 `DAI` for 1 `Loot`.
- `Shares` will be distributed to contributors.
- `HAUS` tokens will be created and given to the HausDAO Minion.

#### HausDAO share allocation

- 90% `Loot` (non-voting tokens with a proportional claim on the GuildBank).
- 10% `Shares` (voting tokens with a proportional claim on the GuildBank).

### Fabrication

The Fabrication phase is when we start work on DAOhaus platform improvements.

#### Transmutation

Transmutation is a contract that enables and enforces the process for HausDAO funding proposals.

- Funding proposals against the GuildBank tokens can only be made through the Transmutation contract to ensure the correct amount of `HAUS` tokens are added to the GuildBank in exchange.
- Funding proposals can only be made from the Transmutation vault.
- Funding proposals cannot be more than 25% of the initial GuildBank holdings per month.

### Devotion

Devotion is the building phase when contributors can earn `DAI` and `Shares` for contributing to DAOhaus.

- Contributors have the option to purchase more DAO shares based on work done (at 10% ratio of funds spent).
- This event happens on an ongoing basis as DAO funds are spent by contributors.
- Contributors can purchase more DAO shares by creating a proposal to deposit 10% of funds paid for work back into the DAO and requesting shares at the rate of 2 `DAI` per share.

> Example: if you earn 1000 `DAI` from contributing to DAOhaus you can then submit a DAO proposal to spend 100 `DAI` to buy 50 `Shares`.

We will reward and prioritize the following contributions (in descending order):

- Contributors in hardcore sprint modes.
- Ownership over outcomes.
- Leading and driving areas of the project.
- High priority tasks and missions.
- Normal contributions.
- Casual contributions.

### Denouement

Denouement is the end of the build phase and the end of the campaign.

- When all primary funds have been spent the bootstrap round is finished.
- At this point, all contributor purchases will be paused.
- `Loot` holders will be asked to rage-quit to redeem their proportional amount of `HAUS` tokens from the GuildBank.
- GuildKick proposals will be used to remove any remaining `LOOT` holders, giving them their `HAUS` but preventing them from continuing to contribute to DAOhaus.
- `HAUS` locked up in the vesting contract will be distributed (see [Summoning Phase](###Summoning-phase) for more details).
- Contributors who were not GuildKicked, did not rage-quit `Shares` and/or `Loot` to then make unauthorized trades on secondary markets, and/or did not acquire `Shares` and/or `Loot` from an unauthorized trade will be given the option to engage in the future growth and development of DAOhaus.

### Rage Quitting

- At any time any contributor can rage-quit to receive a proportional share of the GuildBank assets.
- Rage-quiters should not put `HAUS` on a secondary market. Doing so will invalidate your ability to continue contributing to HausDAO.
- If adverse immaterial events require that a contributor sell their `Shares` or `Loot` they can submit a proposal to sell them to another HausDAO Member or another address approved by HausDAO members. This would require two proposals: one to rage-quit current `Shares` and/or `Loot` and one to mint new `Shares` and/or `Loot` for a current contributor. This would require two HausDAO votes to approve.
- Contributors can execute governance via Rage-quit to remove their donations at any time if they are not satisfied with the direction of HausDAO.
  - Contributors should Rage-quit if contributors are not completing the initiatives described in funding proposals.
  - Contributors should Rage-quit if a funding proposal is sponsored and approved outside of the scope of valid funding proposals (see [Fabrication phase](###Fabrication) for details).
  - Contributor should Rage-quit if a proposal is made to move `HAUS` tokens from `HAUS` bank outside of Transmutation.

While there are no guaranteed outcomes for HausDAO contributors, the balances of power aim to incentivize all parties involved to execute on the HausDAO mission and goals.

- `Loot` holders exercise governance via Rage-quit (can be a portion of shares to send a signal).
- `Share` holders exercise governance via funding proposals (cannot be more than 25% of GuildBank per month).

![HausDAO Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/j8lzI5J.png)

HausDAO will utilize the following contracts for it's construction:

- [Moloch V2](https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch) - A DAO with non-transferable rights that's optimized for grants and investments.
- [Minion](https://github.com/raid-guild/moloch-minion) - A smart account that is controlled by Moloch votes.
- [Transmutation](https://github.com/raid-guild/moloch-contract-extensions/blob/master/contracts/vaults/Transmutation.sol) - A Minion extension that allows for the trustless exchange of an external (revenue) token for GuildBank assets (`WXDAI`). This allows members to pool funds in a DAO, rage-quit capital that isn't committed/drawn-down, but also receive rage-quittable tokens when capital is drawn down. This creates a win/win where members either get their cash back or a claim on an external token in exchange for their cash.
- [Vesting](TBD) - Locks tokens and releases them based on a time delay and/or DAO vote.

The HausDAO will be a Moloch V2. The Moloch V2 code is audited and battle tested. The HausDAO Moloch V2 GuildBank will hold the donations from contributors.

The Minion, Transmutation, and Vesting contracts are not audited. Minion is only responsible for calling the Transmutation contract. Transmutation is responsible for holding the `HAUS` tokens and submitting proposals to the Moloch V2. The Vesting contract will only hold `HAUS` tokens.

If the Minion, Transmutation, and/or Vesting contracts are compromised the tokens in the HausDAO GuildBank will not be affected. `Share` and `Loot` holders will still be able to rage-quit to redeem a proportional share of the GuildBank. In the event that a contract is compromised we can redeploy the `HAUS` tokens and award everyone their due amount. The only GuildBank tokens that might be at risk would be those that the Minion is requesting in a single proposal.
