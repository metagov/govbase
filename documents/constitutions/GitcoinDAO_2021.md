Hi frens,

I'm writing an overview post about Gitcoin, so that prospective DAO participants know the why/what/how of GitcoinDAO.   I plan to update this post every month as the DAO evolves.

## TLDR 

GitcoinDAO is a community of internet citizens who builds & funds digital public goods, like Open Source Software.

So far we've funded $40mm of open source software, & are currently moving about $6mm/quarter to OSS devs.

We are just getting started.

## Mission First

GitcoinDAO is mission first (always has been).  [Our mission](https://gitcoin.co/mission) is to **build and fund digital public goods**.  

### The world we want.

We believe that 
1. Open Source Software is a digital public good that creates $400bn/year in value, 
2. but that creators of OSS don't have great ways to monetize their work on digital infrastructure.
3.  **Our goal is to correct this asymmetry.**

### We are missionaries.

We believe that [it's all coordination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpXPym_m_wA).  Public goods failures are coordination failures, and we see an opportunity to solve coordination failures with blockchains - a new supertool for solving [coordination failures](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/know-thy-enemy-coordination-failures).

### We know our edge.

Blockchains are our super power.  They give us a novel, immutable, global, programmable, transparent substrate for coordination to build upon.  

### We push the envelope.

We develop [novel](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/coordination-party-kit/9231/3) [tools](https://wtfisqf.com/) that solve coordination failures.   

Our weapon of choice is novel mechanism design deployed to decentralized blockchain networks.  

### We have momentum 

We are creating $6mm/quarter in funding for OSS devs.

Vitalik Buterin [once](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/04/30/round5.html) said "Gitcoin Grants is establishing itself as a significant pillar of the Ethereum ecosystem that more and more projects are relying on for some or all of their support."

### We are still emerging.

We are still discovering new & innovative ways to solve  coordination problems in a DAO-era world.   We systematically discover or invent these mechanisms, and if we're lucky + good, we then scale them.  

We are the EVM whispers, the DAO cartographers, the internet citiziens, and the chaos magicians of the internet of money.  [We are the schelling point for the hopeful](https://twitter.com/TrustlessState/status/1418156116282904578).

### We build for human thriving.

Our vision is to establish an empowering, open and collaborative space where individuals and communities can access resources in proportion to their value creation independent of their geographic location, education, background or offline identity. 

By creating collaborative, decentralized funding mechanisms, Gitcoin has become the natural choice for seeding and supporting digital public goods.  The DAO enables building *for* the public, *by* the public by helping individuals and communities start, fund, and scale open source projects.

## How we achieve our mission.

Gitcoin is a mission, a community, and  a product suite.

If our mission is our focal point, our community is our lifeblood.   Our a product - a double sided marketplace that connects digital creatives to the people who want to fund their work. And visa versa.  

So far [we've created $40mm worth of funding for OSS devs](https://gitcoin.co/results).  Specifically, the way we do that is:

1. Giving members opportunities to [earn](https://gitcoin.co/earn).
1. Giving members opportunities to [learn](https://gitcoin.co/learn).
1. Giving members opportunities to [connect with one another & prospective career opportunities](https://gitcoin.co/connect).

### How do we do that?

Product-wise, we are building coordination tools for a DAO based world.  We do that with
1. [Bounties](https://gitcoin.co/bounties/contributor) - gig-based work for web3 projects.
1. [Hackathons](https://gitcoin.co/hackathons) - Build w the coolest web3 projects.
1. [Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants) - Crowdfunding for Open Source.
1. [KERNEL](http://kernel.community/) - A web3-native, community centric accelerator.
1. [coordination.party](https://coordination.party/) - a toolkit for awarding contributors to a DAO. 

Community-wise, we do that by being mission-first, producing results, by creating vibes + cultivating a positively-self-referential internal culture. 

[More on how we achieve our mission here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-we-achieve-our-mission/8760).

## The DAO that governs Gitcoin

We believe that the consent of the governed is the only legitimate basis for government.

This is why Gitcoin is governed by the community.  (In order to make sure that Gitcoin is serving its community + founding mission first & foremost)

In May 2021, [GTC was released](https://gitcoin.co/blog/introducing-gtc-gitcoins-governance-token/).  GTC is a governance token with no economic value that governs Gitcoin Grants + GitcoinDAO.

## What is GitcoinDAO?  

0. GitcoinDAO is an [ImpactDAO/ProtocolDAO hybrid](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-impactdao-protocoldao-sandwich/8944/2).
1. On a human layer, GitcoinDAO is an [egregore](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-gitcoin-gitcoindao-egregore-is-emerging/8200) - a group of humans who coordinate to achieve our mission.  
2. From a product perspective, we are building a suite of tools for DAO-era coordination of [capital & culture](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoindao-meta-coordination-of-culture-capital/8437).  
3. From a governance perspective, we are governed by GTC.
4. [We are progressively decentralize Gitcoin](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/how-might-we-decentralize-gitcoin/8734) from a company to a DAO.

There are 3 important concepts to know to understand how to interact with GitcoinDAO.
1. Most of the action happens on [discord](https://gitcoin.co/discord), [gov.gitcoin.co](https://gov.gitcoin.co), or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/gitcoin).
2. [Stewards](https://gitcoin.co/blog/introducing-the-community-stewards-program/) are ultimately responsible for governing GitcoinDAO.
3. [Workstreams](http://gitcoindao.com/) are the primary mechanism through which work is organized in the DAO.

### DAO Workstreams

Workstreams are the way work is organized in the DAO.  Workstreams have their own budget, leadership structure, tools, and processes on a per-workstream basis.  Anyone can propose a workstream by following the [proposal process](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-dao-governance-process-v2-updated/7860).  The current active workstreams are:

1. [Moonshot Collective](https://www.notion.so/Moonshot-Collective-ffa78f44a0de412cb607f9b69d3a376f) is the DAO rapid prototyping workstream
1. [Public Goods](https://www.notion.so/Public-Goods-80a3202a3a244c65b3fda08c0f7c7d60) is focused on our mission of funding public goods.
1. [Fraud Detection & Defense](https://www.notion.so/Fraud-Detection-Defense-f1a2969a9f324f57a02ef69a60b25cae) is in charge of preventing fraud on Gitcoin Grants.
1. [Decentralize-gitcoin](https://www.notion.so/dGrants-c3197f918bf640bc9809cd26d56c93f3)  is the mechanism through which Gitcoin is progressively decentralizing.
1.  [Memes, Merch, & Marketing](https://www.notion.so/Merch-Memes-Marketing-c1bd89fac8ab4569bf2a676df28025d8) is the DAO marketing division.
1. [dCompass](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-integrate-dcompass-within-dgitcoin-to-build-dquests-dknowledge/8836) - building DAO native orientation tool.

### DAO's Quarterly Cadence

Gitcoin operates in a quarterly cadence.  [Quarterly  Gitcoin Grants Rounds are our Metronome](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-is-our-metronome/9310)

Every quarter, the Gitcoin ecosystem revolves around a quarterly stacked event - *a combination (1) Gitcoin Grants round, (2) Hackathon, (3) KERNEL block, and (4) Governance activity*

During each quarter,  we achieve our mission by deploying millions of $$$ of funding to the community.  Typically a quarter looks like this:

1. Plan for quarterly stacked event.
2. Execute quarterly stacked event.
3. Learn from the quarterly stacked event.
4. Repeat 

The next quarterly event is GR12 (short for Grants Round 12) + it started December 1 2021. 

## DAO KPIs

Right now the DAO is focused on:
1. Creating more ecosystem impact (measured in $$$ distributed to devs).
2. Decentralizing Gitcoin 

Here's how we're tracking so far.
1. [$40mm in total public goods funding issued](https://gitcoin.co/results), $6mm/quarter right now.
2. We've launched a DAO + several coordination protocols form the DAO.

[Ongoing discussions on these KPIs here.](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/what-are-the-kpis-that-gitcoindao-optimizes-for/8497).  [You can see the network stats here](https://gitcoin.co/results)

## GitcoinDAO is a vessel for humanity to get to  the *Quadratic Lands*!

The GitcoinDAO is a vessel that we would like to take us to the Quadratic Lands - a place where open source software (and other public goods) are well maintained + healthy.  

In the quadratic lands, public goods are funded by quadratic funding + other web3 native funding mechanisms.  

The quadratic lands is a north star, we are still discovering where exactly it is and how to get there

Help us find the quadratic lands by telling it';s story.  Members of our community have created  <a href="https://twitter.com/songadaymann/status/1397206547420356611">this song  about the Quadratic Lands</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTU6J4WTPtk"> and this visionary video</a>.
