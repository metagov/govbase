# Agave Community Covenant

Agave is a Decentralised lending protocol and digital community. In lew of the Agave DAO ratifying its own covenant, we will adopt the pledge and standards from the 1Hive DAO

## The Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our community include: - Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people - Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences - Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback - Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience - Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include: - The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind - Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks - Public or private harassment - Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission - Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## On-chain enforcement

The on-chain mechanism for enforcement will depend on the completion of Celeste.

The ability for the Agave protocol to enforce this covenant is limited to the direct interactions that community members have with the protocol, specifically the ability for community members to submit proposals to allocate Honey issuance or adjust protocol parameters.

A community member will be required to stake Honey when submitting a proposal, attesting that the impact of the proposal could be reasonably considered to align with Agave’s social contract. A dispute can be created by another community member if they disagree with the proposers attestation by challenging the proposal and staking an equivalent amount of Honey. If after being challenged the proposal is not withdrawn, a decentralized oracle will be used to settle the dispute.

Participants in the dispute resolution protocol are expected to review the proposal, this covenant, and related past disputes in order to provide a judgement that they feel best aligns with the established norms and intention of the Agave community.

If the oracle responds in favour of the proposer the proposal will be unlocked and the challenger’s stake will be transferred to the proposer. On the other hand, if the dispute resolves in favour of the challenger the proposal will be removed from consideration and the proposers stake will be given to the challenger.

## Off-chain enforcement

While there is no canonical off-chain forum that represents the Agave community, there are community spaces including the Agave GitHub, Discourse, and Discord communities, and others forums which may emerge in the future which are expected to adhere to this covenant.
