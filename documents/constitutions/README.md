# Govbase Digital Constitutions

The Govbase Digital Constitutions data set consists of a number of constitutions written for DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations), blockchain projects, and other online communities.

## Contributing

If you would like to upload a (raw) constitution for a given online community, please submit a pull request to add a file to this folder, preferably as a .md file. At the top of the constitution, please include a link to the original constitution using this format: 

// Archival copy. Original URL: <URL, e.g. https://www.google.com >. Date archived: <Day-Month-Year, e.g. 19-11-2021>.

Please make sure that the section titles are recognizable!

A few of the above constitutions have been processed using the [Constitute Project](https://www.constituteproject.org) ontology, allowing them to be compared directly with Constitute's data set of over 200 national constitutions. If you would like the raw version to be annotated using the Constitute ontology, please message josh@metagov.org.

## What is a constitution?

Typically, a constitution articulates *rights*, *values*, and *goals* within the context of an organization's *decision-making*. It will often, but not always, describe the decision-making process of that organization, as well as any important institutions within that process (e.g. a legislative body, a president, a treasurer). All corporations have formal constitutions. All DAOs have a [computational constitution](https://medium.com/commonsstack/exploring-daos-as-a-new-kind-of-institution-8103e6b156d4) encoded into their smart contract. Every Discord has a computational constitution embedded in the server settings. Most online communities do not possess formal constitutions.

Not sure if your governance document is a constitution? Constitutional rights and values are specified informally in all sorts of places: blog posts, manifestos, covenants, governance.md files, etc. Just submit a pull request, and we can help you figure it out. Some constitutional documents are very short (less than 10 sentences), while others are drafted by lawyers and span 20+ pages.
