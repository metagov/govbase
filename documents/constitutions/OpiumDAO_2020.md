# Opium DAO: Community voting principles (v1.0.0)

This is a formalized criteria on how to participate in the signaling process at Protocol governance by starting a proposal.

## Before the proposal

Take into consideration starting a discussion on the forum to attract the community's sentiment before starting a proposal. This step is not necessary for all issues and may always be skipped for urgent issues.

Ensure that you have sufficient time for signalling. The proposal should last at least 48 hours for important matters and 7 days for general matters after going live. Anything less than 48 hours does not give governance participants a decent chance to signal on the issue because many participants do not frequently check the forum. In some situations, however, the issue is urgent and some signal is better than no signal at all. In these cases, this 48 hours length should be ignored with appropriate justification and signal vote started right away.

## Constructing a proposal

The proposal should be about a single issue to prevent the topic from becoming a mess of different discussions.

Begin with a summary of the essential information - the form should consist of pros/cons, positive and negative sides and all updates on the thread should be seen in the initial post (it is the responsibility of the proposal author).

Try to find a consensus on the proposal to suit most of the community.

Neutral phrasing - the content and title of the proposal must be written in neutral language to avoid prejudice of other community members.

Link the proposal to the initial discussion on the forum. Clearly defined lines of progress on the proposal.

## During the proposal

Facilitating discussion and engagement in good faith: It is important to encourage people to participate in the signaling process and seek out opinions from both sides. Keeping the discussion going and engaging with all who participate is essential and this responsibility belongs to the proposal author. The proposal author does not have to remain neutral on the issue but does need to run the signaling process in good faith to its conclusion.

On-chain actions: The proposal may contain on-chain actions defined to be executed on behalf of the DAO. If the signal request contains on-chain actions, they must be passed to execution through SafeSnap processes after the request's lifecycle ends with a successfully approved outcome.

Note that thread starters cannot close an active signal request thread once it has gone live.
