## The data
Govbase is organized into tables of interlinked data to support a variety of projects at Metagov, which can be navigated by the Airtable tabs. For each table, views are defined to examine various properties of the table.

## Accessing the data

Govbase can be accessed in view-only mode at the [public Airtable link](https://airtable.com/shrgnUrj0dqzZDsOd/tblvk3EFzcoCFvXXi/viwTisATNcua7os4y). To get a one-time export of a particular table or view, contact Metagov.

To access the Airtable API, you will need an Airtable account and to request editor access to the base from Metagov. The auto-generated Airtable API documentation can be found [here](https://airtable.com/appx3e9Przn9iprkU/api/docs). 

## Getting involved
Govbase is a crowdsourced, community effort. We’re always looking for more editors, contributors, and research partners. If you would like to do research with Govbase, contribute data, or if you have an existing mapping project that you’d like to integrate, please get in touch!
