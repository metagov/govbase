# Bright Charter 

## What is BrightDAO?

BrightDAO is a community of thinkers and doers that have come together to support and grow BrightID, an app and network that creates a socially-managed graph that can be analyzed to increase Sybil Resistance for all projects that choose to use it. The more projects and individuals using BrightID, the more nuanced and robust the graph becomes--opening up new ways to discover and exclude malicious users, creating a world where people can experience a more fair and equal opportunity.

## Our Vision

BrightDAO believes that all humans can benefit by being able to prove their uniqueness, that they should have the right to maintain their privacy, and that BrightID is a tool to achieve this goal. 

We believe that BrightID is a critical component of any self-sovereign digital identity solution.

Our vision is to live in a world where individuals are able to own and manage a self-sovereign digital identity irrespective of location and nation-state jurisdictions. 

## Our Mission

To create a participatory, community-driven economy powered by the Bright token that enables the support, development, engineering, and adoption of the BrightID social identity network.

To realize this mission a community currency will be issued. It will then be allocated through a decentralized proposal process to projects that the community considers worthy. Proposals can be submitted by anyone willing to stake the required minimum of Bright tokens, but proposal validity is constrained to the following purposes:

- Providing funding for any manner of contribution which helps BrightID become a privacy-preserving, decentralized, Sybil resistant identity network that is broadly adopted and useful
- Providing funding for integrations of the Bright token that help ensure the sustainability and growth of BrightDAO and the BrightID network
- Determining the community’s support for an idea through a Suggestion (“Signalling”) proposal without requesting funding

A proposal that does not adhere to the Vision, Mission, or Values established in this document, can be disputed by any community member by invoking [Celeste](https://celeste.1hive.org) to provide a resolution.
